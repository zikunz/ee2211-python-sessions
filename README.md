This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks I developed from scratch for the Python Sessions (originally “Python Clinic Sessions,” but I prefer just “Python Sessions”) in EE2211 Introduction to Machine Learning at the National University of Singapore (AY24/25, Semester 1). I refactored the original demo code into smaller, more focused cells and augmented them with practical Python programming examples. Each notebook is enriched with detailed markdown explanations that clarify both the fundamental Machine Learning concepts and the corresponding code, promoting deeper understanding and stronger practical skills.

In AY24/25 Semester 2, I was invited by the course lecturer to teach two additional sessions in Week 8. This led to minor updates in the “Optional Python Session (Week 8).ipynb,” including the replacement of an anonymous feedback link and the removal of future plans, since I taught from Week 8 to Week 13 in the preceding semester. Optional Python Session (Week 8).ipynb helps students learn how to use Python as a calculator for problem-solving and perhaps more importantly, prepare for their midterm test. All notebooks are uploaded here in the hope that future EE2211 students will find them valuable for reviewing essential topics and enhancing their learning experience.
